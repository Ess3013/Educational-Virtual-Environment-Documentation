# Educational Escape Rooms

## Intro

Educational escape rooms have become a hot topic in education research due to their potential to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. These immersive experiences, modeled after popular recreational escape rooms, challenge students to solve puzzles and complete tasks within a set time limit to "escape" a themed room. Researchers are exploring how educational escape rooms can foster critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills while making learning more enjoyable and memorable. Studies are examining the effectiveness of escape rooms across various subjects and age groups, investigating their impact on student motivation, achievement, and attitudes towards learning. As research continues to shed light on the benefits and best practices of educational escape rooms, they are poised to become a valuable tool in modern classrooms.
