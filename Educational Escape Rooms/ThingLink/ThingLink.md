### Multimedia Editor

The Multimedia editor tool in ThingLink is a versatile tool that allows you to use images, 360° images, 3D models, videos, 360° videos, or a mix of multiple forms of media.

You can start with your first multimedia project by clicking on:

#### Image

The first type of media you can use is an image. You can uplaod an image as shown below.

Once you upload an image, you will see a bunch of options to add interactions to the image like:
- Add tag
- Settings
- Done

**Add tag** button allows you to add different types of tags or annotations to your image like:
- Text and media
- Text label
- Embed
- Transit
- Poll
Each one of these tags has a specific look and purpose which will be explained below.

The first tag **Text and media** allows you to insert any text, image, or video inside the tag as shown below. You can change the tag icon, write a title, and write a description or body text.

The second tag **Text label** allows you to insert text that appears in a small label instead of a large popup.

The third tag **Embed** can be used to embed any html element or youtube videos.

The fourth tag **Transit** allows you to transition to another media to make point-and-click experiences.

![chrome_x8cOV0UBGS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa9c823-ace0-44ad-8358-951f38940042)

This is how a transit looks like to the user.

The last tag **Poll** works in a similar manner to the other tags but it tracks the users clicks on the poll and provides choice percentages.

##### Example

You can see most of the steps and tags mentioned above being used in this [example](https://www.thinglink.com/view/scene/1891618027372282724).

#### 3D model

3D models can be imported in most common formats and you can insert tags exactly like inserting tags in images. You can upload a 3D model as shown below.

![chrome_1i5ZEXxAX5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/764ea5ad-94cb-4eae-81ad-de8eeb9f8a35)

Once you have uploaded your 3D model you can add tags by clicking on the part where you want your tag to be. After that, you can insert text or embed an html element, a youtube video, an audio, or a link.
