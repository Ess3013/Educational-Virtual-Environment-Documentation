p5.js is a friendly tool for learning to code and make art. It is a free and open-source JavaScript library built by an inclusive, nurturing community. p5.js welcomes artists, designers, beginners, educators, and anyone else! 

It can be used to make interactive games or activities using html elements like text, buttons, sliders or shapes like squares and circles. p5.js is limitless in its capabilities for all artistic or interactive projects.

# How to use p5.js for escape rooms?

p5.js can be used to create any interactive activities you would like to add to your educational escape room. Here are some examples of using it:
- [**_Example 1_**](https://editor.p5js.org/eslamessam/full/uTCHZmL_I)
- [_**Example 2**_](https://editor.p5js.org/eslamessam/full/PkEVDB5Ab)
- [_**Example 3**_](https://editor.p5js.org/eslamessam/full/oT-bY5eie)

To use p5.js and create your own activities, you start by opening the [**_p5.js editor_**](https://editor.p5js.org/) and signing up at the top right to be able to save your projects.

## Manual Coding

You can approach coding on p5.js in one of two ways. You can either learn the basics of the library and write your own code, or you can ask AI to write you the code you need by describing your requirement to it.

To learn the library you can access the p5.js [**_Reference_**](https://p5js.org/reference/) page to learn all the built-in functions with their examples. You can also explore dozens of public [**_examples_**](https://editor.p5js.org/p5/sketches) to learn about the endless possibilities of using p5.js.

## AI-assisted Coding

You can use any AI tool to write your code like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/u/0/app), or [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F%3F).

These AI models are very good at writing code. However, they can only code as good as the prompt you give them. Therefore, there are no rules for coding on p5.js using AI, but you should keep a few things in mind about your prompt to get the desired code from them:
- Mention the language or library you want (p5.js in this case).
- Don't let the AI conclude what you want. Give them as much details as you can.
- Try the code and give detailed feedback for edits.

Another use for AI in the workflow is to get inspiration for escape rooms and puzzles from it, which greatly reduces workload on the educator and lets the AI do the heavy lifting.
